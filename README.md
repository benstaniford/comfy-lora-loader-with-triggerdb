# LoRa Loader with Trigger Database

A ComfyUI custom node that provides a LoRa loader with persistent trigger word storage. Automatically saves and loads trigger words for each LoRa model, making your workflow more efficient.

> **Note:** This node is designed to be used in conjunction with a prompt combiner node such as **CR Combine Prompt**. Use this node to manage and store trigger words, then connect its outputs to a prompt combiner to build your final prompt for generation.

## Features

- **Dual Trigger Fields**: Separate "All Triggers" and "Active Triggers" text fields
- **Auto-loading**: Automatically loads saved triggers when selecting a LoRa
- **Load/Save Buttons**: Explicit buttons for loading and saving trigger words
- **Persistent Database**: Stores trigger words in JSON format between sessions in {Comfy}/models/loras/triggers.json
- **Stores all/active triggers**: Can be used to store all the triggers but also just the one you're currently using

## Node Details

**Inputs:**
- `model`: Base model to apply LoRa to
- `lora_name`: LoRa selection dropdown  
- `strength_model` / `strength_clip`: LoRa strength values (-20.0 to 20.0)
- `all_triggers`: Text field for all available trigger words

## Database

Trigger words are stored in `triggers.json` in your ComfyUI loras folder:

```json
{
  "lora_name": {
    "all_triggers": "masterpiece, best quality, detailed",
    "active_triggers": "masterpiece, best quality"
  }
}
```

The database file is created automatically and handles migration from older formats.
